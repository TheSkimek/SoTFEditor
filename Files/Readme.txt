SaveGame Editor Tool for "Sons Of The Forest"
Created by TheSkimek
#################################################################################

Warning: 
ALWAYS Backup your save files before trying to change anything with or without this tool!

This tool can help you change some save files without having to go through the files yourself,
find the correct location and what to change.

Current functions include:
- Create Backup of save files
- Change your inventory (also works with items you didnt have in your inventory yet)
- Give all currently available items into inventory
- Remove all items
- Change armor to whatever you like (armor points will be set to 9999)

If there are still items i missed, there is a "ItemIDList.csv" file in the "Files" folder, where you can add any ItemId yourself.
It does NOT work with items that are not (yet) in the game, like for example the rifle. Unreleased items that are added like this, will be
automatically deleted from the file by the game.

I plan on adding some further functionality, but as this is just a little freetime sideproject, i dont promise anything.
