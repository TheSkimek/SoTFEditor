SaveGame Editor Tool for "Sons Of The Forest"
Created by TheSkimek
#################################################################################

Warning: 
ALWAYS Backup your save files before trying to change anything with or without this tool!

This tool can help you change some save files without having to go through the files yourself
and find the correct location and what to change.

Currently you can only change your inventory. It also works with items you didnt have in your inventory yet.

There is a "ItemIDList.csv" file in the "Files" folder, where you can add any ItemId i missed (i will try to update it myself too).
It does NOT work with items that are not (yet) in the game, like for example the rifle. Unreleased items that are added like this, will be
automatically deleted from the file by the game.

I plan on adding some further functionality, but as this is just a little freetime sideproject, i dont promise anything.
